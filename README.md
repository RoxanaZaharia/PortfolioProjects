# PortfolioProjects

Excel Project – Data Visualization 
The Objective of this project was to communicate key insights clearly, quickly and powerfully
and accentuate that selecting the right type of chart is critical.


SQL Project – “Maven Movies” 
The Situation: My business partner and I were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing Maven Movies. He primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he has lots of questions for us about our 
business and the rental business in general. His offer seems very generous, so we are going to entertain his questions.
The Objective of this project was to leverage my SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven Movies database to answer my potential Acquirer's questions. 
Each question will require me to write a multi-table SQL query, joining at least two tables. I used MySQL.
